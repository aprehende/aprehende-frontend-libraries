### Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Make sure you have:

- Nodejs
- npm, yarn or pnpm
- git

### Node version

First of all let's use version 16 of node so we don't have compatibility problems, for this we can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) just run in the repository folder the command:

```bash
$ nvm use
```

This command will look for the .nvmrc file and will find the version with which the project was created.

---

### Development environment

Use Gitpod, a free online dev environment for GitHub.
